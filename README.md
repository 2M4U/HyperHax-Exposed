# HyperHax-Exposed
##### Discord: https://discord.gg/NujXDQKYzm
Over the past year or so a well-known Call of Duty Exploit Tool known as "HyperHax" has ruined the COD Community by allowing people to purchase their reversed engineered software that manipulates COD's game mechanics, such as "Bot Lobbies" and "XP Grinder", this software they provide is a malicious piece of software that has been encrypted/obfuscated to hide from the games Anti-Cheat system aswell as bypass your Anti-Virus software, which can and will cause devastating consquences to your device, such as RCEs (Remote Code Execution) or worse. 

For those who don't understand how this software works, it essentially hooks into the game on load-up to initialize the "Cheats", when it first came about this tool could cost you anywhere from $1000 to $10,000 depending on how "private" a certain exploit the tool had, Dark Aether Camo exploit when it first reached the "hacking/exploit" scene, the source code for this particular exploit caused anywhere up to $10,000 meaning that the developers of the tool would increase the purchase price of the tool and there was no such thing as "Lifetime" at the time of release during the period of the DA Exploit.

It has now come to light after approx a year since they actually did any form of real update that if you purchase/download their software and see you are "growing" in the community due to their software or potentially making your own tools that do pretty much exactly what their tool does, they would instantly token log you.
There has been circulation throughout the Cod-Modding Community that HyperHax has been cracked and source code released, now with that said numerous members of the COD Community have stated there is infact a Discord Token Logger within the source code that was cracked, so being a Cyber Security Enthusiast I took it upon my self and found something disturbing for such a well known exploit tool in the community.

### Feel free to make a PR if you have anything to add
###### Currently looking for the latest .exe of their shitty tool to deobfuscate and release publicly to expose them further on their trash development and token logging schemes.
